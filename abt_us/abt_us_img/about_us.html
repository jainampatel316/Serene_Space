            <h3>The problem</h3>
          </div>

          <div class="prob-cont">
            India’s mental health is in a state of crisis. While 1 billion
            people around the world live with a mental health condition, India
            alone accounts for a third of the global burden of depression,
            addictions, and suicides. India has the youngest population in the
            world - and yet, over 100 million children and youth have diagnosed
            mental health conditions.&nbsp;<br /><br />
            Due to a confluence of inadequate awareness, societal stigma, and
            limited access to high-quality care, individuals grappling with
            mental health challenges frequently find themselves unable to access
            the necessary treatment and support for recovery. India is currently
            facing a mental health crisis. Despite one billion people worldwide
            dealing with mental health conditions, India alone shoulders a
            significant portion of the global burden, particularly in terms of
            depression, addictions, and suicides. Notably, India boasts the
            world's youngest population; however, distressingly, over 100
            million children and youth are diagnosed with mental health
            conditions, underscoring the urgent need for attention and action in
            this critical area.
